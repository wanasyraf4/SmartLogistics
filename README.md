iv. Create a database and collection in the UI, this is where we will store our example document. <br>

### Step 2: Code on Raspberry Pi Pico W

>egress.py

> note:
> Insert your internet name, internet password, MongoDB Data API URL, and API Key accordingly in the code. <br>
> In the payload you need to add your cluster, database, and collection names. <br>
> We are simply connecting to WiFi and sending a payload to their API with extension /action/insertOne, which will allow us to insert one document. We are using some dummy data for this example!
